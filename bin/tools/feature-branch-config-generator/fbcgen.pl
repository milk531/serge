=head1 NAME

fbcgen.pl - Feature branch config generator.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<fbcgen.pl> is a companion tool for `feature_branch` Serge plugin.

It scans the master branch in Git and determines the list of qualifying
branches to run localizations against, and then, based on a provided
Serge config template, generates the actual Serge config suitable
for using with `serge sync` to localize all qualifying branches at once.

Qualifying branches are determined as follows:
1) If branch name matches the $skip_branch_mask, it is skipped.
2) If branch name matches the $unmerged_branch_mask, and it is unmerged
   into a master branch, it is included in branch candidates.
3) If branch name matches $any_branch_mask, it is included
   in branch candidates.
4) If $branch_list_file is defined, the file is loaded and parsed;
   in this file lines starting with `#` are considered comments and skipped;
   other lines are treated as branch names (each line is a branch name);
   if branch name is prefixed with `-`, the branch is skipped;
   otherwise the branch name is added to the list of candidates.
5) for each candidate, up to $commit_depth last commits are analyzed, and commit
   lines formatted with $commit_format that match $skip_commit_mask are skipped
   (this is usually needed to skip commits from l10n robot itself). The date
   of last qualifying commit is checked against $old_branch_threshold,
   to see if the branch is still active.

See sample `myproject.cfg` and `myproject.tmpl` files for more information.
